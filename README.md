# CLI Employee Tracker

## Description
This project I was tasked with creating a command-line application that enables users to effortlessly create departments, roles, and employees. Beyond initial creation, users have the capability to modify employee roles as needed. Information is presented in clear tables within the CLI application, offering a straightforward interface for viewing and managing additions and updates. To streamline selection processes, SQL SELECT queries are employed to present users with a list of available options directly in the command-line interface, eliminating the need for manual ID input.


## User Story

SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer
